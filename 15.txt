Why State Storage Methods Are Needed & Where They Are Used
==========================================================

Why Are They Needed?
--------------------
- RL agents must remember past experiences, actions, and rewards to learn effective policies.
- Storing state-action values (Q-values) or experiences enables agents to estimate future rewards and make better decisions.
- Without proper storage, agents cannot generalize, adapt, or improve over time.
- Storage mechanisms allow agents to learn from both recent and distant experiences, improving sample efficiency and stability.

Where Are They Used?
--------------------
- Q-tables: Used in simple, discrete environments (e.g., gridworld, classic control problems).
- DQN/DDQN: Used in complex, high-dimensional environments (e.g., video games, robotics, continuous control).
- Neural Networks: Used in deep RL, policy gradient methods, and environments with raw sensory input (images, audio).
- Replay Buffers: Used in off-policy algorithms (DQN, DDQN, SAC) to improve sample efficiency and stability.
- Hybrid/Custom Methods: Used in advanced RL research, multi-agent systems, and specialized tasks.


Real-World Examples:
--------------------
- Chess Engines:
	- Stockfish: Uses advanced search algorithms and evaluation functions, storing millions of positions and transitions in hash tables and transposition tables.
	- AlphaZero: Utilizes deep neural networks and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to learn chess, shogi, and Go from scratch, storing state-action values and policies in neural networks.
- Video Game AI:
	- DeepMind's DQN: Learned to play Atari games directly from pixels using deep Q-networks and replay buffers.
	- OpenAI Five: Used LSTM networks and massive experience replay to master Dota 2, storing complex state and action histories.
- Robotics:
	- Boston Dynamics robots: Use RL and neural networks to learn locomotion, balance, and manipulation, storing sensor data and learned policies.
- Autonomous Vehicles:
	- Waymo, Tesla: Use RL and deep learning to optimize driving policies, storing state transitions, sensor data, and action outcomes for safe navigation.
- Industrial Automation:
	- RL agents optimize energy usage, production schedules, and maintenance, storing operational states and learned strategies.

More Examples:
- Recommendation Systems: Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon use RL to personalize content, storing user states, actions, and feedback.
- Finance: RL agents trade stocks, manage portfolios, and hedge risks, storing market states and transaction histories.
- Healthcare: RL optimizes treatment plans, drug dosing, and resource allocation, storing patient states and outcomes.

Summary:
--------
State storage is fundamental for RL agents to learn, adapt, and perform well in diverse environments. The choice of method impacts scalability, learning speed, and overall agent intelligence. Real-world RL systems leverage creative storage and learning mechanisms to achieve superhuman performance and solve complex problems.
