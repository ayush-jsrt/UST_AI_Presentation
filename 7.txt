FHIR & AWS HealthLake
=====================

FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a global standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. It defines how healthcare data is formatted, shared, and accessed, making it easier for systems to interoperate and for organizations to collaborate securely.

How HealthLake Uses FHIR:
- HealthLake ingests healthcare data from various sources (EHRs, labs, devices)
- Data is normalized and stored in FHIR format, ensuring consistency and interoperability
- FHIR resources (Patient, Observation, Condition, etc.) allow for structured queries and analytics
- Enables seamless integration with other FHIR-compliant systems and applications

Benefits:
- Simplifies data exchange between providers, payers, and patients
- Supports advanced analytics and machine learning on standardized data
- Reduces integration complexity and improves data quality
