Reinforcement Learning (RL)
==========================

Reinforcement Learning is a branch of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties and aims to maximize cumulative reward over time. RL is widely used for tasks that require sequential decision-making and adaptation.

Key Concepts:
- Agent: The learner or decision-maker
- Environment: The system the agent interacts with
- Actions: Choices made by the agent
- Rewards: Feedback signals for actions
- Policy: Strategy for choosing actions
- Value Function: Expected long-term reward

Applications:
- Robotics and autonomous systems
- Game AI and strategy optimization
- Recommendation systems
- Industrial automation

RL enables systems to learn complex behaviors and adapt to changing scenarios through trial and error.
